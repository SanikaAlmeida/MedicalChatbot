This project is a Streamlit-based chatbot that answers user queries using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It combines a FAISS vector store for document retrieval and a Hugging Face model (Mistral-7B-Instruct) for generating accurate responses. The chatbot uses Sentence-Transformers to convert documents into embeddings for efficient retrieval.
